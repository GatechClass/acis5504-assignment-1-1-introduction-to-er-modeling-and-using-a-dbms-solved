This assignment gets you started thinking like a database designer. You will learn concepts from chapters 3 through 8 and and implement them using MS Access or other DBMS.

The activities of this assignment are covered in Modules 02 through 08 and implement course objectives #1 through 4.

Each of the questions from this quiz are related to a database that you are to implement in MS Access or other DBMS. To prepare for the quiz you should do the following activities:

Step 1: Create the following tables using MS Access or other DBMS.

This database will require the following entities (shown below). The primary key fields are denoted in bold letters, and the foreign keys are denoted in italics and underlined.

Account(ANO, ANAME, STREET, CITY, STATE, ZIP)

Transactions(TID, TDATE, AMOUNT, STOREID, ANO)

Store(STOREID, SNAME, STREET, CITY, STATE, ZIP)

One account can have many transactions and one store can have many transactions.

When you take the quiz you will confirm that you created the tables.

Step 2: Create an ERD for this situation.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct ERD from multiple choices.

Step 3: Confirm the tables are presented in the assignment as a Relational Model.

When you take the quiz you will confirm that the tables are defined in a correct Relational Model format.

Step 4: Insert rows in the tables, at least 5 stores, 5 accounts, and 30 transactions.

When you take the quiz you will confirm that you populated the tables.

Step 5: Create a form that allows a user to insert and update data for a table.

When you take the quiz you will attest that you created the form.

Step 6: Create a report that lists all accounts.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct SQL for this report from multiple

choices.

Step 7: Create a report that lists all transactions for a given day.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct SQL for this report from multiple choices.

Step 8: Create a report that is a monthly statement for a given individual account that lists the date, Sname, and the amount of the transaction for that account. The user must specify the

month. At the end of the statement, the total amount should be summed.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct SQL for this report from multiple choices.

Step 9: Create a report that lists all transactions for a given account number.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct SQL for this report from multiple choices.

Step 10: Create a query that inserts a row into the Transaction table.

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify the correct SQL for this step from multiple choices.

Step 11: Study Chapter 6: Normalization

When you take the quiz you will be required to identify remedies to normalization violations from multiple

choices.
